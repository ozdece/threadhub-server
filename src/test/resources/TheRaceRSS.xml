Nevertheless, it&#x2019;s not one without truth or merit because there are genuine similarities in how the two very different sporting disciplines are mastered.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t believe me? Then ask a chess master. Don&#x2019;t have access to one? No problem, we have.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/annaheadshot6.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Why Formula E really is a game of high-speed chess" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/annaheadshot6.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/annaheadshot6.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/annaheadshot6.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w2400/2026/02/annaheadshot6.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The 23-year-old Anna Cramling earned her first&#xA0;FIDE rating - FIDE titles&#xA0;are awarded by the international&#xA0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess?ref=the-race.com">chess</a>&#xA0;governing body&#xA0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE?ref=the-race.com">FIDE</a>&#xA0;(Federation Internationale des Echecs for outstanding performance) in February 2013, aged 10. She then earned the&#xA0;Woman FIDE Master (WFM) title in 2018.</p><p>&#x2018;Chess prodigy&#x2019; is a decent description for Cramling as she descends from two chess grandmaster parents, Juan Manuel Bellon Lopez and Pia Cramling. Destined to grace the board, she has not only been one of the world&#x2019;s top players but has also brought chess to new dimensions of popularity through live Twitch streaming.&#xA0;</p><p>Late in 2025, Cramling took part in a promotional film with Jaguar TCS Racing. It caught The Race&#x2019;s attention, not because it was fun, which it really was, but more so because it gave a very different take on the endless links to strategic thinking and multi-adaptational task execution, which stands Formula E apart from most other motorsports.&#xA0;</p><p>Formula E drivers spend a significant amount of time in the driver-in-the-loop simulator (DiL) because at races, they have a lot on their to-do list. Apart from driving the car and racing it against 19 other highly skilled competitors, they have almost corner-by-corner feedback to store and occasionally communicate back to their engineer in real time.</p><p>In addition, they have to ensure their energy consumption is on target and they call this back in cryptological code because radio transmissions are audible to everyone, meaning the transmissions include sensitive information like battery percentage, energy management, and powertrain settings.</p><p>But is it really so simplistic as to say the sports are similar in all but speed? Cramling thinks not.</p><p>&quot;I really think it is really similar in that way, as when you&apos;re playing chess, you&apos;re constantly thinking about a lot of different variations,&#x201D; Cramling tells The Race.</p><p>&#x201C;So, you&apos;re constantly thinking, &#x2018;OK, if I do this move, then this will happen in the position&#x2019; and &#x2018;my opponent can reply in these different ways&apos;. Then within every branch of those different ways, you have to calculate many different variations.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;It&apos;s not just OK to think &#x2018;if I do this, then my opponent might do those&#x2019;.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>Although you&#x2019;d think that a chess player is operating at a much slower pace, in terms of clarity of thought, you might need to think again.</p><p>&#x201C;It&apos;s many different branches of thought that you need to have all the time,&#x201D; adds Cramling.</p><p>&#x201C;You&apos;re constantly thinking several steps ahead, and you&apos;re also doing that at quite a high speed, because of course, there&apos;s different time controls in chess.</p><p>&#x201C;But, even if we&apos;re talking about classical chess, where the games are quite long, because there&apos;s so many different variations, you may have to make a decision within five or 10 minutes, so you&apos;re actually calculating these different moves at quite a high speed.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="multi-move-psycho-dramas">Multi-move psycho dramas&#xA0;</h2><p>Chess is by its very nature a lot more psychological than motorsport and this is where the real jeopardy lies. But like Formula E, it has a certain correlation in risk and reward, mental peril and hazard.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;It&apos;s, of course, not physical,&#x201D; says Cramling.</p><p>&#x201C;You&apos;re not in any risk of physical damage. But in a way it&apos;s so psychological that you really feel like you are kind of at risk somehow, or that you are in the sense it matters so much. There is no physical risk when it comes to chess. But there is a mental risk.&#x201D;</p><p>Formula E kind of has both. Perhaps the stark case study of this was Sebastien Buemi&#x2019;s infamous Montreal meltdown in July 2017. After a sizable accident in free practice, he fought back through to a brilliant fourth place. But it came at a cost.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOQnYKDExaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="S&#xE9;bastien Buemi In Extraordinary Post-Race Tirade! Hydro-Quebec Montreal ePrix"></iframe></figure><p>Minutes after finishing the race, the then-reigning champion went on a ludicrous rant down the pitlane, in which, comedically, he picked fights with <em>three </em>drivers (Antonio Felix da Costa, Robin Frijns and Daniel Abt) in three minutes. Some still believe that Buemi was actually concussed in the earlier accident. Whatever, it showed that physical and mental toil can have consequences.</p><p>That&#x2019;s not to say chess doesn&#x2019;t come without its physical aspects too. Cramling uses the phrase &#x2018;drained&#x2019; a lot, and with good reason.</p><p>&#x201C;After playing for five or six hours and having your brain constantly be on very high alert,&#x201D; she says.</p><p>&#x201C;You might be in a position where you have five or 10 seconds left on the clock, you have to make very difficult positions that will change everything. Your brain is completely fried.</p><p>&#x201C;And of course, there is a difference between motorsport and chess. But I think it&apos;s more interesting to highlight that, even though on the outside they&apos;re so different, there are all of these similarities.&#x201D;</p><p>While a chess equivalent of Buemi&#x2019;s antics haven&#x2019;t been replicated in such spectacular self-detonation, there have been episodes on the chess circuit. However, an infamous &#x2018;table slam&#x2019; by top player Magnus Carlsen in Norway in 2025 frightened the life out of his victorious rival, Gukesh. </p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Current World Champion Gukesh defeats Magnus Carlsen for the first time in classic chess. <a href="https://t.co/4tDFBjon9c?ref=the-race.com">pic.twitter.com/4tDFBjon9c</a></p>&#x2014; non aesthetic things (@PicturesFoIder) <a href="https://twitter.com/PicturesFoIder/status/1929477072482640226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=the-race.com">June 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>A frustrated Carlsen banged his fist on the board, causing Bishops and Queens to jump to attention and a shocked Gukesh to walk away in mixed disbelief and satisfaction on outsmarting his opponent.&#xA0;</p><h2 id="competitive-instincts-shared">Competitive instincts shared</h2><p>When da Costa and Evans met Cramling the mutual respect was pretty evident. Despite the clear differences in their sporting disciplines, it was very evident to Cramling that the competitive desire was there, even if Evans erroneously addressed the classic and most numerous but weakest chess piece as a &apos;prawn&apos;.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;They really cared about beating each other,&#x201D; says Cramling.</p><p>&quot;I can definitely tell that they want to win, that they have this fire within them that you need to be a professional competitor in any sport.</p><p>&#x201C;Also, they were very fast thinkers, and they learned very easily different things, and were able to remember and retain information, and I could tell that they were really listening and understanding. Just the speed of learning as well, I think was quite high in just 20 minutes of filming, which was incredible.&#x201D;</p><p>The driver relies on a vast team of engineers, mechanics, operative personnel, data specialists when exercising their craft. The perceived wisdom and thought is that chess is a completely individual sport. Think again.</p><p>&#x201C;Before really knowing about motorsport, I saw it as if someone crashes the car, it&apos;s up to the individual,&quot; Cramling added. &quot;I think chess, in a similar sense that you actually have a lot of coaches and people preparing you behind the scenes.</p><p>&#x201C;You have people constantly trying to understand what the opponent will play, and they will sit for maybe five or six hours coming up with the best lines to face that person.</p><p>&#x201C;Because if the person that was competing was doing that themselves, they&apos;ll be totally drained for the match. They can&apos;t be the ones doing that. They need other people that are preparing them so they really know what&apos;s going to happen during the match.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Another similarity, another case in point that the most dynamically opposed sporting quests share many traits.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;I have so much respect for everyone that is competing and that are racing drivers, because I feel like it&apos;s something that I could personally myself never do,&#x201D; says Cramling.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&apos;t even have a licence. But I&apos;ve asked the drivers at Jaguar, and I told them that if they play chess, then they can teach me how to drive.&#x201D;</p><p><em>Images courtesy of Jaguar TCS Racing</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Where did they get that? What the hell? I need to ask them where they made that.&#x201D;</p><p>The answer to his question is that the steering wheel &#x2013; and in fact the whole car &#x2013; is not something that Red Bull made at all.</p><p>It is instead one element of the ultra-realistic official &#x2018;Gen 26&#x2019; F1 show cars that are produced by British company Memento Exclusives and which Red Bull used one of at its launch. </p><p>The modern world of F1 show cars is one that not many people know about, so The Race caught up with Memento to find out more about the technology and industry behind it.&#xA0;</p><h2 id="like-the-real-thing">Like the real thing</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/2026-Show-Car-Full-Build-Draft1.00_08_07_14.Still006_email.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Inside the hidden world of an F1 launch season linchpin" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/2026-Show-Car-Full-Build-Draft1.00_08_07_14.Still006_email.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/2026-Show-Car-Full-Build-Draft1.00_08_07_14.Still006_email.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/2026-Show-Car-Full-Build-Draft1.00_08_07_14.Still006_email.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/2026-Show-Car-Full-Build-Draft1.00_08_07_14.Still006_email.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There was a time when Formula 1 show cars would have been made up from bits of old race machinery with some added plastic bits to make them look good and current.</p><p>But those days are gone. Nowadays, the official F1 show cars are high-precision machines created with the same CAD, the same manufacturing processes and built using the same carbon fibre materials that&#xA0;are used with the real cars.</p><p>That quality means they look so much like the real thing that teams are happy to use them on stage at their official launches.</p><p>It was a Memento&#xA0;show car&#xA0;that Red Bull revealed its livery on; it was a Memento&#xA0;show car&#xA0;that Audi did the same with at its livery launch.</p><p>It will also be a Memento&#xA0;show car&#xA0;that Cadillac will be using for its livery reveal at the Super Bowl this Sunday night. </p><p>As Barry Gough, CEO of Memento Exclusives, tells The Race about the show cars: &#x201C;The product has to be good these days.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="a-growing-business">A growing business</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/PXL_20260123_102239952-copy2_email.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Inside the hidden world of an F1 launch season linchpin" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1505" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/PXL_20260123_102239952-copy2_email.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/PXL_20260123_102239952-copy2_email.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/PXL_20260123_102239952-copy2_email.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/PXL_20260123_102239952-copy2_email.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The&#xA0;show car&#xA0;element of Memento is now a central pillar of its business and potentially makes the company the biggest producer of F1 cars in the world &#x2013; with 180 show cars set to be made this year.</p><p>Memento first started building show cars before the previous regulation change in 2022. But its ever-stronger relationship with teams, and a licensing arrangement it has with F1, has made it scale things up fast.</p><p>It has helped transform what Gough started out as a memorabilia business 15 years ago into a full-scale manufacturing programme today. He now employs 120 staff at a 70,000 square foot facility.</p><p>Turnover in the next financial year is expected to be &#xA3;75million - &#xA3;45million of that will be from manufacturing, and &#xA3;30million of that will be from memorabilia.</p><p>Gough, a former number one mechanic at BAR and who started his F1 career at Simtek, is now running an operation as big as F1 teams used to be.</p><p>&#x201C;I would say there would be about 70 people involved in the&#xA0;show car&#xA0;process from the drawing office to build,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But then you include finance and it&#x2019;s more.</p><p>&#x201C;I was at Simtek Grand Prix in 1994, and I&apos;ve got four times more people than they had.&#x201D;</p><p>Efforts to ensure that things are done to the right standard has meant that he has hired ex-F1 staff who have good knowledge of what teams expect.</p><p>This includes designers who worked with top teams plus his head of manufacturing Terry Wasyliw, who was composite fitting shop manager at the Mercedes F1 team for more than 20 years.</p><p>As Gough (pictured below) said: &#x201C;We understand what the teams want and what the quality has to be.&quot;&#xA0;</p><h2 id="the-build-process">The build process</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/0N2A8919.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Inside the hidden world of an F1 launch season linchpin" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/0N2A8919.JPG 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/0N2A8919.JPG 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/0N2A8919.JPG 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/0N2A8919.JPG 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Producing each official&#xA0;show car&#xA0;to the specification required is not the work of the moment.</p><p>Gough explains it is a multi-month process from his team receiving the first CAD drawings to the finished product.</p><p>&#x201C;This first 2026 project took us eight months to get from there to where we are now,&quot; he said.</p><p>&#x201C;But if someone gave us the CADs now, I would say it&#x2019;s about 18 weeks to get from us then manipulating them, to then machining and tooling and getting to the finished product.&#x201D;</p><p>While underneath the skin the show cars feature none of the complicated systems the&#xA0;real things need &#x2013; like brakes and hydraulics - every element that can be seen from the outside is made to look as genuine as possible.</p><p>&#x201C;We have a dummy engine, but it looks like an engine,&#x201D; added Gough. &#x201C;We have a rear impact structure, which is carbon, so that looks real. Then we have got rain lights that look real, and the suspension all looks real.</p><p>&#x201C;The uprights aren&apos;t as spec as an F1 car, but they are real uprights with bearings that we&apos;ve designed.</p><p>&#x201C;Also, our cars are pitstoppable as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/XPB_1340448_HiRes.jpg" alt="The dilemma surrounding WEC driver crews"><p>As part of a trend that began in 2024, more and more Hypercar teams have chosen to favour two-driver line-ups over trios for the six-hour World Endurance Championship races. At the Sao Paulo 6 Hours last year, seven of the 18 cars entered in the top class were shared by pairs. Many newcomers are also considering doing the same.</p><p>At the end of 2024, organisers the Automobile Club de l&apos;Ouest and the FIA even briefly considered making three-driver crews mandatory, before ultimately backing down. </p><p>But does running two drivers actually offer a real advantage? That&apos;s what we&apos;ll try to assess.</p><h2 id="what-the-regulations-say">What the regulations say</h2><p>In LMGT3, a crew of two or three drivers must include at least one Bronze-rated driver, plus either another Bronze or a Silver driver. Bronze and Silver drivers must also respect minimum driving times, set at 1h45m, 2h20m and 2h55m respectively for six-, eight- and 10-hour races.</p><p>Our focus here, however, is Hypercar. In that category, line-up composition is free, provided it does not include a Bronze driver. As a result, for WEC races excluding the Le Mans 24 Hours, two-driver line-ups are permitted. That said, nobody dares to contest a race longer than six hours with just two drivers.</p><p>It should also be noted that if a driver is entered but does not take part in the race at all, the car will be disqualified, except in cases of force majeure recognised by the stewards. At the Le Mans 24 Hours, drivers must complete at least six hours of driving time, but no more than 14 hours in total, and may not drive for more than four hours in any six-hour period.</p><p>Finally, Article 13.2.3 of the WEC sporting regulations states that, for all categories, any driver who has driven less than 45 minutes in total will not score championship points, in addition to any other applicable penalties.</p><h2 id="a-brief-history-of-two-driver-crews-in-wec">A brief history of two-driver crews in WEC</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/01/XPB_530725_HiRes.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The dilemma surrounding WEC driver crews" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/XPB_530725_HiRes.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/XPB_530725_HiRes.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/XPB_530725_HiRes.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w2400/2026/01/XPB_530725_HiRes.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the past, top-class WEC cars have occasionally been entrusted to duos. Rarely, however, was this the result of a deliberate choice; more often it stemmed from the absence of one of the usual three drivers, either due to calendar clashes with another championship or because of health issues.</p><p>Notable examples include Audi&apos;s #2 car in 2012, after Dindo Capello retired from prototype racing following the Le Mans 24 Hours, or Toyota&apos;s #7 when Kazuki Nakajima was committed to Super GT or Formula Nippon. In 2014, after Nicolas Lapierre was dropped, Toyota&apos;s #8 finished the season with just Sebastien Buemi and Anthony Davidson.</p><p>But in the Hypercar era, it was Cadillac Racing that truly set the trend in 2024, running a two-driver line-up for all six-hour races.</p><p>This year, Aston Martin and Porsche Penske Motorsport have followed suit. When BMW M Team WRT, Peugeot Sport or Toyota Gazoo Racing have fielded duos, it has been due to the unavailability of one of their regular drivers.</p><p>In total, since the rebirth of the WEC in early 2012, only five races have been won by two-driver line-ups - just 4.9%.</p><p>The first dates back to 2012, when Alex Wurz and Lapierre delivered Toyota&apos;s maiden WEC victory in Sao Paulo (pictured above). The most recent came at last year&apos;s Spa 6 Hours, when Will Stevens and Callum Ilott won in the Jota-run Porsche 963 without Norman Nato, who was tied up in Formula E.</p><h2 id="advantages-and-drawbacks">Advantages and drawbacks</h2><p>Last season, Porsche Penske Motorsport opted for two-driver crews for the majority of six-hour races - a strategy made easier by its parallel IMSA SportsCar Championship programme, allowing it to call upon its IMSA drivers for longer events. </p><p>&quot;It was super positive,&quot; said Porsche LMDh boss Urs Kuratle. &quot;You have one less opinion when setting up the car, so there&apos;s less compromise.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s definitely better. And the drivers like it because they get more seat time, particularly in free practice. That means more time to understand the set-up and more one-on-one time with the engineers. But for Austin, which is a physical race, we decided to go with three-driver line-ups.&quot;</p><p>In a six-hour race weekend, teams have just four hours of free practice, meaning limited running time and even fewer opportunities to work on long stints.</p><p>&quot;When conditions are hot, as they can be at Austin, it&apos;s better to have three drivers because they&apos;re &apos;fresher&apos; when they get in the car,&quot; added BMW M Motorsport boss Andreas Roos. &quot;Everyone has their own opinion, but personally I don&#x2019;t see a clear advantage or disadvantage to either option.&quot;</p><p>One major downside, if a team is not also competing in IMSA, is that the third driver arrives at races less prepared than the other two, while being relegated to an unenviable &apos;stand-in role&apos; that brings added pressure - particularly given the importance of the Le Mans 24 Hours. This is why at the Spa 6 Hours, the last race before the Le Mans 24 Hours and therefore considered a dress rehearsal, teams call on all their drivers.</p><p>Another drawback that is not immediately obvious concerns track limits penalties, which are driver-specific rather than car-specific. Whether a car has two or three drivers, each driver receives a drive-through after their fifth track limits offence in a WEC race - or the 12th at Le Mans.</p><p>Porsche&apos;s #5 car fell foul of this at the Fuji 6 Hours. After Julien Andlauer was handed a drive-through for repeated track limits infringements, Porsche Penske Motorsport decided to leave Mathieu Jaminet in the car for the final four hours to avoid another penalty.</p><h2 id="why-not-make-three-driver-line-ups-mandatory">Why not make three-driver line-ups mandatory?</h2><p>At the end of 2024, in an effort to reduce disparities, the ACO and FIA considered making three-driver crews compulsory. With almost no competitors in favour, however, the idea was quickly abandoned.</p><p>&quot;As long as the calendar clashes with IMSA and Formula E, it wouldn&apos;t be fair to introduce such a rule,&quot; admitted Roos. &quot;It would force teams to hire more drivers, which means extra cost. I think it&apos;s up to the competitors to decide.&quot;</p><p>That view is widely shared. Forcing teams to run trios would require them to bring a reserve driver to every race, something Porsche Penske Motorsport had done in 2025.</p><p>&quot;At a standard six-hour event, if something happens to one of your drivers, you can always fall back on a duo,&quot; explained Peugeot Sport technical director Olivier Jansonnie. &quot;But if you start with two drivers instead of three, you always need a reserve on site in case one of the regulars has to withdraw.&quot;</p><h2 id="what-are-the-plans-going-forward">What are the plans going forward?</h2><p>The 2026 season should not be the most complex, as there are no clashes between WEC and Formula E, which could otherwise have affected five drivers. There is, however, a conflict between WEC (Imola) and IMSA (Long Beach) on the weekend of April 18-19.</p><p>As a result, several cars will be run by duos in Italy, including BMW&apos;s M Hybrid V8s, with Dries Vanthoor and Sheldon van der Linde committed in the US. The same applies to #38 Cadillac&apos;s V-Series.R with Jack Aitken.</p><p>For now, Aston Martin is the only team that has decided to run just two drivers at all six-hour races. Alpine had long considered the option but has since backed away. At category newcomer Genesis Magma Racing, the situation remains unclear.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re waiting to see how competitive the car is,&quot; said team sporting director Gabriele Tarquini. &quot;We may take decisions on a race-by-race basis.</p><p>&quot;The positive of running two drivers is that the more experienced ones get more seat time and can continue developing the car over a race weekend. But you also have to make sure the third driver is properly integrated. Everything is still open.&quot;</p><p>Ford and McLaren are also believed to be considering two-driver crews for six-hour races in their first Hypercar season in 2027.</p><p>&quot;Watching and speaking to the drivers about the majority of the races, which are shorter, we feel a two-driver line-up is the way to go,&quot; McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown said on TV during the Silverstone 4 Hours European Le Mans Series round.</p><h2 id="what-about-le-mans-with-two-drivers">What about Le Mans with two drivers?</h2><p>As surprising as it may sound, the Le Mans 24 Hours was contested with two-driver crews for a long time. It was not until the 39th edition that, officially, a three-driver line-up appeared: Nicolas Koob, G&#xFC;nther Huber and Erwin Kremer, who finished 10th in 1971 in a Porsche 911 S.</p><p>It then took until the 45th running, in 1977, for the first victory by a trio: the #4 Porsche 936 of J&#xFC;rgen Barth, Hurley Haywood and Jacky Ickx. Even then, Ickx had initially been entered in the #3 car, which retired after just three hours. At the time, drivers were allowed to switch cars during the race - a practice that was later banned.</p><p>The first true winning trio was therefore the one that claimed victory in 1983 in the works Porsche 956, driven by Haywood, Al Holbert and Vern Schuppan. The 1984 edition was the last to be won by a two-driver crew: Klaus Ludwig and Henri Pescarolo in the Joest Racing Porsche 956 #7.</p><p>The most recent voluntary attempt at Le Mans with a duo dates back to 1997, when Fabien Giroix and Jean-Denis Del&#xE9;traz failed to qualify their Lotus Elise GT1. More recently, in 2009, Charles Zwolsman and Andre Lotterer were forced to race without Narain Karthikeyan after the Indian driver injured his shoulder climbing over the pitwall just minutes before the start after a last-minute trip to the toilet.</p><p>However, if circumstances require it, the stewards may adjust minimum and maximum driving times. They have even accepted a two-driver crew at Le Mans not long ago. In 2014, following a testing accident that forced Bret Curtis to withdraw, Cooper MacNeil and Jeroen Bleekemolen contested the race as a duo. Their Prospeed Competition Porsche 911 RSR #79 was moved from GTE Am to GTE Pro, as the line-up no longer included a Bronze-rated driver.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That can be seen, below, with the red highlight here on the McLaren under the old ground effect regulations.</p><p>As the slot in the rear of the floor leading into the diffuser exit has been enlarged this year, I suppose it should now be called &quot;the rathole&quot;, and it certainly could put the cat among the pigeons in terms of performance.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Image-7.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson on the 2026 return of an F1 design trend" loading="lazy" width="640" height="456" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Image-7.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Image-7.jpeg 640w"></figure><p>The lead illustration shows how the opening is on the Mercedes. It&apos;s believed to allow airflow to be pulled through it into the diffuser expansion area, which is similar to the effect with the mouseholes that we have seen before.</p><p>But why would you want to reduce the performance of the diffuser with such a big opening?</p><p>As is always the case with these cars conceptually, it&apos;s not quite as simple as that.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Image-6.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson on the 2026 return of an F1 design trend" loading="lazy" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Image-6.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Image-6.jpeg 640w"></figure><p>The slot is positioned well after the start of the diffuser expansion area. The inner surface of the brake duct (green line) is there to contain the airflow spilling off the inner corner of the tyre where the tread meets the sidewall (yellow arrows). It even has a small duct (orange) in the lower section to allow more of the flow lower down into another inlet route.</p><p>Internal to that inner surface of the brake duct, there is also another vertical splitter (highlighted in red). This will contain that flow spilling off the tyre corner and help redirect it around the inside of the tyre into the void where the tyre tread comes away from the track surface.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/image-2.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson on the 2026 return of an F1 design trend" loading="lazy" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/image-2.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/image-2.jpeg 640w"></figure><p>To complicate the airflow structure even more in this area, the small louvres on the floor&apos;s top surface allow airflow to be pulled through them (magenta arrows). These will help reduce the airflow that is being pulled under the floor by the low pressure underneath the car and connect it to the tyre squirt, which is the airflow created by the squeezing effect from the tyre tread meeting the track surface. If this can be achieved, it will improve the performance of the underfloor in this area.</p><p>I have highlighted this tyre squirt with the purple arrows showing what will probably try to go inboard and the red arrows showing what will probably try to go outboard. The red arrows are longer than the purple arrows because the objective here is to maximise the outwash and minimise the inwash. If that outwash can connect up to the airflow that these louvres set up, then more airflow will be extracted outwards and again improve the sealing mechanism of the underfloor.</p><p>Mercedes has also added what looks like a small wing section above the floor, increasing the power of that outward airflow (yellow arrows) in that area.</p><p>Where this inlet duct is positioned is behind where the diffuser ramp starts and it could be just about where on the inner surface the diffuser boat tail sweeps inwards fairly dramatically around the gearbox. If it sweeps inwards too dramatically, it is a prime area for airflow separation - so optimising the airflow on the inner diffuser wall might just mean that this opening is required in this area of the diffuser to reduce the risk of airflow separation further outboard.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/image-3.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson on the 2026 return of an F1 design trend" loading="lazy" width="723" height="469" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/image-3.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/image-3.jpeg 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As we can see from these pictures, above and below, most of the other frontrunners have, to some degree, an opening in this area. They also have the secondary turning vane mounted to the inner surface of the brake duct.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Ferrari-4--1--1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson on the 2026 return of an F1 design trend" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Ferrari-4--1--1.png 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/Ferrari-4--1--1.png 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/Ferrari-4--1--1.png 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Ferrari-4--1--1.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>McLaren (for now) is the exception, although from this picture it could be just around the corner. If it&apos;s not, I&apos;m sure we will see its interpretation of this opening in Bahrain.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/McLaren-susp-no-mousehole.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson on the 2026 return of an F1 design trend" loading="lazy" width="1202" height="801" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/McLaren-susp-no-mousehole.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/McLaren-susp-no-mousehole.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/McLaren-susp-no-mousehole.jpg 1202w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Is it legal? We often talk about the grey areas, but grey is simply a lighter shade of black and to get that you mix white with it.</p><p>As with many areas of discovery across these new cars, I doubt that much is black and white and I&apos;m sure the FIA will have a close look at it, but I doubt that the height of the lower edge of the diffuser sidewall is defined even in the 264 pages that make up the technical regulations.</p><p>As long as it&apos;s not a hole and it&apos;s a cutout, I don&apos;t see it being a problem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/M560816.jpg" alt="Mercedes rivals plotting F1 engine rule change for Melbourne"><p>Mercedes&#x2019; rivals are hoping to pull together a proposal to change Formula 1&#x2019;s engine compression ratio rules in time for the start of the season in Australia, The Race has learned.</p><p>However, even if they agree on a plan, any chance they have of new regulations being pushed through so quickly would still require support from the FIA and FOM - something that is far from guaranteed.</p><p>Amid the ongoing controversy surrounding <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/trick-at-centre-of-2026-f1-engine-loophole-controversy/" rel="noreferrer">Mercedes having potentially found a loophole to run its car at a higher compression ratio than the 16:1 limit</a> stated in the rules, efforts have been ramping up among its competitors to stop any advantage it has.</p><p>The issue revolves around the current rules making it explicit that checks for compression ratio compliance are done at ambient temperature. It is suspected Mercedes has found a way to run at a higher level when the engines are hot.</p><p>Discussions have been ongoing over recent weeks among Mercedes&#x2019; rivals to try to agree to a proposal for&#xA0;a different test procedure being implemented &#x2013; which would involve compliance being measured when the power unit is hot.</p><p><a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/f1-engine-manufacturers-set-for-two-meetings-loophole-controversy/" rel="noreferrer">Two further meetings have taken place with the FIA</a> to discuss the matter in recent days. One involved technical experts on Monday and another the Power Unit Advisory Committee (PUAC) on Thursday.</p><p>There were some reports on Friday that coming out of these meetings new procedures for checking had been agreed for the start of the season. Multiple sources have said that this is not the case at all.</p><p>However, while the outcome of both meetings is that the current regulations and checks remain in place as defined in the rule book, this has not stopped efforts accelerating behind the scenes between Mercedes&#x2019; rivals to get things changed.</p><h2 id="voting-bloc">Voting bloc</h2><p>It is understood that the aim of Mercedes&apos; competitors is to agree amongst themselves a new procedure to measure the compression ratio when engines are running hot.&#xA0;</p><p>Their plan would then be to put forward this new idea to the PUAC for a vote so it can be introduced - with sources suggesting it is seeking things to move in time for the Australian GP.</p><p>Several options for a different way of checking have been discussed, which include the use of sensors when the car is running out on track, or ensuring measurements are taken in the garages when engines are up to operating temperature.</p><p>And critically it has emerged that the trio who had initially been most animated about the matter and <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/everything-we-learned-about-impact-of-f1-2026s-loophole-controversy/" rel="noreferrer">wrote a joint letter to the FIA &#x2013; Ferrari, Audi and Honda</a> &#x2013; have now potentially won over the support of Red Bull too.</p><p>The fact that four manufacturers could be aligned on a proposal to tweak the regulations is significant because it opens the door for the necessary super majority vote that would be needed to make an immediate rule change.</p><p>Red Bull&#x2019;s stance is interesting because it was understood that it had found benefits from interpreting the regulations in the same way as Mercedes.&#xA0;However, it could be that it has found itself unable to produce the gains hoped for &#x2013; which is why it may be more eager to shut that avenue down.</p><p>Under the governance procedures of the PUAC, for a significant immediate modification of the power unit rules to happen, it requires backing from four of the current five manufacturers, plus support from both the FIA and FOM.</p><p>Normally, the FIA and FOM vote in a bloc and it is very rare for them to not be aligned over matters.</p><p>So key to any hopes of Mercedes&#x2019; rivals getting a swift rule change pushed through is whether or not any proposal they agree on would have backing from the governing body.</p><p>Up until now, every indication has been that the FIA is aligned with Mercedes&#x2019; interpretation of the rules &#x2013; in that compression ratios are always measured in ambient conditions.</p><p>The F1&#x2019;s 2026 power unit rules were altered on October 16 to emphasise this was the way measurements would be taken, and earlier this week, <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/toto-wolff-blasts-f1-rivals-for-secret-letters-about-loophole-controversy/" rel="noreferrer">Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said</a> such a viewpoint had been backed by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.</p><p>Asked about the risk of one of Mercedes&#x2019; rivals protesting the matter in Australia, Wolff said: &#x201C;The power unit is legal.</p><p>&#xA0;&#x201C;The power unit corresponds to how the regulations are written, and the power unit corresponds to how the checks are being done.</p><p>&#x201C;The power unit corresponds to how these things are measured in any other vehicle. Everything else [the chances of a protest] I can&apos;t judge upon.</p><p>&#x201C;That&apos;s how we see the world today, and that&apos;s what the FIA said. That&apos;s what the president of the FIA said, and he knows a bit about that. In that respect, let&apos;s wait and see. But we feel robust.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="too-late">Too late</h2><p>A sudden U-turn by the FIA in approving a last-minute rule tweak that altered the way that the compression ratio was measured would be a surprise - and could potentially have a huge impact on the competitive picture.</p><p>This is especially true because final homologation of power units takes place on March 1 so there is no time for anyone to change designs.</p><p>Despite an eagerness from Mercedes&#x2019; rivals to get things changed from the start of the season, it is much more likely that if there is support for a new direction this would only be something for the longer term &#x2013; potentially from the start of 2027.</p><p>But Wolff made clear earlier this week that he was frustrated about the way his team&#x2019;s competitors were spending so much time on this issue.</p><p>&#x201C;I just don&apos;t understand that some teams concentrate more on the others and keep arguing a case that is very clear and transparent,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>&#x201C;Communication with the FIA was very positive all along. And it&apos;s not only on compression ratio, but on other things too.</p><p>&#x201C;Specifically in that area, it&apos;s very clear what the regulations say. It&apos;s very clear what the standard procedures are on any motors, even outside of F1.&#x201D;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/GnG_1288849_HiRes.jpg" alt="&apos;It&apos;s correct like this&apos; - Has Bagnaia accepted Ducati MotoGP exit?"><p>Ducati&apos;s two-time MotoGP champion Pecco Bagnaia sounds resigned to an exit from the manufacturer&apos;s ranks for 2027 - and is targeting a swift resolution to his future in the series.</p><p>The priority rider within Ducati&apos;s ranks not so long ago, Bagnaia was made expendable by the arrival of Marc Marquez and his own erratic form in 2025 - and all signs now point to him being pushed out in favour of a Marquez-Pedro Acosta Ducati works line-up for next year.</p><p>Neither Ducati, nor Bagnaia have publicly acknowledged this as being the case. The manufacturer has been steadfast in its insistence that it is currently prioritising Marquez&apos;s yet-to-be-confirmed renewal and will only then turn to filling the other seat.</p><p>But Bagnaia has certainly dropped hints that he is having to look elsewhere.</p><p>He told the series&apos; broadcaster after the Sepang test that he was &quot;more or less in the same boat&quot; <a href="https://www.the-race.com/motogp/alex-marquez-says-motogp-2027-decision-imminent/" rel="noreferrer">as Alex Marquez,</a> who had said he has offers pending and needs to make a prompt decision.</p><p>&quot;On the table in front of me I have great opportunities,&quot; Bagnaia said. &quot;And I will decide very soon.&quot;</p><p>He had thanked the print media during the test for not asking him about a 2027 deal, and when that question finally came on the final day he quipped: &quot;I said thanks to you [for not asking]!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still speaking. It&apos;s clear that a season like last year can put you on the wrong side [of the market]. But still speaking. I have many opportunities, and we just need to decide.&quot;</p><p>Considering that Bagnaia had always previously suggested he would be ready to re-commit to Ducati, and considering that there is no indication Ducati will have made him a works team extension offer at this point, his current options must logically all be alternatives.</p><p>These should include the likes of Yamaha (which is gaining momentum in the rumour mill), Aprilia (which has already re-signed his good friend Marco Bezzecchi) and perhaps Honda. </p><hr><p><strong><em>Who&apos;s looking strong - and who&apos;s in trouble?</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Here&apos;s what we learned </em></strong><a href="https://www.the-race.com/motogp/six-things-we-learned-from-motogps-sepang-test/" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>from MotoGP&apos;s first 2026 test at Sepang</em></strong></a></p><hr><p>One option that doesn&apos;t appear to be of much interest is remaining within the Ducati ranks in a satellite ride - perhaps with the VR46 team of his mentor Valentino Rossi.</p><p>When asked about this by Italian media, <a href="https://www.gpone.com/it/2026/02/05/motogp/bagnaia-2027-in-un-team-satellite-ducati-io-sono-un-pilota-da-prima-linea.html?ref=the-race.com" rel="noreferrer">as reported by GPone,</a> Bagnaia responded that he is a &quot;frontrunning rider&quot; in MotoGP and should make a decision accordingly.</p><p>&quot;There are many opportunities. Fortunately what I have achieved in recent years is certainly helping now. Without pressure and without rushing, I will take what I see as the right decision.&quot;</p><p>The reality of most likely being ushered out of a seat he&apos;d won two titles - and the reality of that decision being made before a single racing lap in 2026 - is a brutal one for Bagnaia.</p><p>Though Casey Stoner&apos;s peaks were higher and Marquez overshadowed him upon his arrival last year, it remains that no rider has won more MotoGP titles with Ducati, nor won more MotoGP races, nor taken more poles, nor scored more podiums. </p><p>None of that credit in the bank appears to have been enough to earn him a stay of execution on the decision - much less secure a 2027 extension.</p><p>At least publicly, it is a state of affairs that Bagnaia has accepted and does not complain about.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s what it is. We are living in a world that is always super-fast. So you need to be quick. </p><p>&quot;And as Jorge Lorenzo said correctly - you are remembered for the last races you do. It&apos;s normal that it&apos;s like this. It&apos;s correct that it is like this. </p><p>&quot;Surely in the last three-four years the contracts [for next year] are decided much before, much sooner, but it&apos;s like this. And honestly, I think it&apos;s correct.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

for the beginning of Formula 1&apos;s 2026 rules but the initial indication from Barcelona testing is that the leading engine manufacturers are closely matched. &#xA0;</p><p>Sweeping changes to F1&#x2019;s car and engine rules are tipped to reshuffle the F1 pecking order this year with Mercedes long mooted to be in the best position.</p><p>This was reinforced by its test-topping mileage and strong early performance in Spain last week, but the reliability of the Ferrari and the first engine built by the new Red Bull Ford Powertrains company also made an impression, even with Mercedes.</p><p>McLaren&#x2019;s initial assessment from Barcelona, while loaded with caveats given the test was even less representative than usual, is that the performance of those three engine manufacturers did not seem drastically different.</p><p>It is clear that there are at least three competitors &#x2013; Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull &#x2013; who have all got off to a good start,&#x201D; Stella said.</p><p>&#x201C;In particular, the Brackley team has definitely raised the bar, and we will have to work hard to do the same.</p><p>&#x201C;The fact that the three teams I mentioned are equipped with three different power units is a first indication that there may not be extremely marked differences in terms of absolute performance, at least as far as some of the PU suppliers are concerned.&#x201D;</p><p>Barcelona comes so early in everyone&#x2019;s testing programmes that there could be much bigger differences at the next two weeks of testing in Bahrain once teams start to run their engines harder, especially as the energy recovery and power deployment demands will not be the same.</p><p>But Stella&#x2019;s comments are a cautiously encouraging early verdict given the prevailing sentiment that such a big rules change, and Mercedes&#x2019; perceived position, could lead to big gaps between teams based on which engine they have.</p><p>These tests are taking place against the backdrop of discussions over F1&#x2019;s reduced compression ratio rules for 2026 and the belief that Mercedes has interpreted those rules - legally - in a way that could give it as much as three tenths of a second advantage compared to the others on some tracks.</p><p>If the usual leading teams are on relatively even ground in terms of outright engine performance, then it will become more of a battleground in exploiting the new 2026 energy demands along with traditional car development.</p><p>And it has been suggested after Barcelona that the works teams are currently in a better place for optimising the engines because of the information they had more immediate access to during the development phase.</p><p>&#x201C;Although these are very preliminary indications, I believe that one of the areas where there is great room for improvement is in exploiting the new power unit and all the options available to the driver,&#x201D; added Stella.</p><p>&#x201C;There is also a lot of potential to be extracted in terms of managing the variable aerodynamic configuration, referring to the alternation between corner and straight mode.</p><p>&#x201C;That said, it is obvious that this generation of single-seaters is at a very early stage of development: four years ago, when ground effect cars made their debut, we were in different circumstances because the power unit and tyres were essentially unchanged from the previous year.</p><p>&#x201C;More than ever before, this year it will be the ability of the teams and drivers to exploit the package at their disposal, as well as the ability to develop the car in the right direction, that will make the difference.</p><p>&#x201C;In any case, what we see in the first part of the season in terms of the balance of power will almost certainly not be the same as what we see in the second part, precisely because the effects of car development in an early phase, such as the one we are experiencing now, can only be very significant.&#x201D;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Norris-Barcelona-D3.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="McLaren&#x2019;s interesting initial verdict on how top F1 engines compare" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Norris-Barcelona-D3.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/Norris-Barcelona-D3.jpeg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Norris-Barcelona-D3.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Mercedes had such a disappointing performance from 2022 through to 2025, failing to fight for a single world championship, that it was overhauled by engine customer McLaren &#x2013; which peaked by winning both championships last year.</p><p>Even if the Mercedes engine proves to be the class-leading design, that leaves a question mark over which team using it will be in the best position.</p><p>Having left the build of its MCL40 late, and not running as much in the test as a result, McLaren seems to have more work to do at this stage of testing to fully understand its car and then plot its development priorities.</p><p>&#x201C;What we saw on the track was in line with expectations and, above all, with the simulations,&#x201D; said Stella.</p><p>&#x201C;What emerged clearly is that the learning curve is very steep for everyone &#x2013; drivers and teams alike &#x2013; which means that every lap teaches you something useful in terms of performance.</p><p>&#x201C;It was natural to expect such a scenario, considering that these cars are totally new, from A to Z.</p><p>&#x201C;We know that the MCL40 is a good starting point, but now we have to work hard to develop it and improve the overall performance of the package, both for the immediate future and to further define the development lines during the season.&#x201D;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/5.jpg" alt="Why F1 race starts will be much more difficult in 2026"><p>Plenty has been said already about the energy management challenges that come with Formula 1&apos;s new 2026 cars.</p><p>But there is another key area where F1 drivers are going to face a bigger headache than before thanks to a combination of new systems and a fresh rule.</p><p>We are talking about race starts.</p><p>Anyone standing at the pitlane exit during F1&apos;s first pre-season test at Barcelona, to see drivers practicing their getaways, could not help noticing how different and clunky they looked.</p><p>From the perfectly balanced revs, clutch releases and getaways that became the norm with the previous generation of cars, early impressions of the 2026 cars are of things looking a bit more unrefined.</p><p>Once the car is stationary and the clutch is engaged, drivers are revving the engine a lot higher and for a lot longer than before.</p><p>But once the clutch is released, the high revs do not appear to translate to a lightning-fast getaway on the edge of perfect traction.</p><p>Instead the cars initially appear to bog down, and there seems to be a tremendous amount of inconsistency.</p><p>That external impression has been verified by those in the cockpit too - with world champion Lando Norris admitting that race starts are now going to be a step more difficult.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s quite a bit trickier,&quot; he said.</p><h2 id="dodgy-gaps-in-power">&apos;Dodgy&apos; gaps in power</h2><p>The cause of this is three factors coming together: hardware changes on the car, reluctance to burn battery power for fear of running out later in the lap, plus a key new regulation regarding the initial getaways.</p><p>On the power unit front, F1&apos;s removal of the MGU-H has made turbo lag much more of a problem with the new generation of engines.</p><p>The MGU-H had previously been used as an electric motor to help spin up the compressor turbine, meaning it filled in power deficits triggered by lag so that acceleration remained instant and constant.</p><p>This is why starts were so good previously - because the turbo was primed to deliver the peak power for the getaway.</p><p>As Norris said about the new cars losing that tool: &quot;You don&apos;t have the perfect amount of battery to kind of fill in the dodgy gaps.&quot;</p><p>Without the MGU-H, turbo lag can now only be overcome through two means.</p><p>One is to use the MGU-K and battery power to spool the turbo up, but this risks wasting energy that could be more useful later in the lap.</p><p>The other is to simply keep engine revs high, something which we have seen happening in corners as drivers aim to ensure the turbo is kept spinning so it&apos;s ready for the exit.</p><p>For the start, the option of using the MGU-K to keep the turbo spooled up is totally off the table.</p><p>Article 5.2.19 of the technical regulations states that when the car is on the grid prior to the start &quot;the MGU-K torque may only be negative&quot; - that is to say, charging the energy store - &quot;except for torque requested by an MGU-K active damping strategy whose sole purpose is to protect the MGU-K mechanical transmission&quot;.</p><p>So drivers are not allowed to use the MGU-K to prep their turbo on the grid.</p><p>The only way to do it therefore is by keeping the revs super high so the compressor is spinning perfectly the moment the clutch is released.</p><p>But even once the clutch is released, restrictions remain in place for drivers which mean that any turbo lag still left in the system because they didn&apos;t execute things perfectly cannot be filled with the MGU-K.</p><p>In a perfect world, as the MGU-H did previously, the MGU-K would help fill in any power deficit to deliver the perfect start if drivers got it wrong before the lights went out.</p><p>Now, an all-new rule for 2026 outlaws any use of the battery power for the initial start phase.</p><p>Article 5.2.12 states: &quot;During a standing start from the grid the MGU-K may only be used once the car has reached 50km/h.&quot;</p><p>The end result is that any driver that has not balanced the revs, clutch release and turbo speed perfectly for the getaway is going to have no means of recovering until they are up to at least this speed.</p><p>But even past the 50km/h point, it&apos;s not a given that drivers will want to tap into using battery power to help dig them out of a hole.</p><p>Right now, F1&apos;s 2026 cars are energy-starved, and that means drivers need to keep their batteries as charged as possible for the best points on each lap.</p><p>So while burning through energy would be logical in helping fill in for turbo lag on the run to the first corner, it would be wasted if that meant being left with an empty battery that makes you a sitting duck coming out of it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/G_7MpQKXEAAT1ls--1--1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Why F1 race starts will be much more difficult in 2026" loading="lazy" width="1688" height="1125" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/G_7MpQKXEAAT1ls--1--1.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/G_7MpQKXEAAT1ls--1--1.jpeg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/G_7MpQKXEAAT1ls--1--1.jpeg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/G_7MpQKXEAAT1ls--1--1.jpeg 1688w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Haas driver Ollie Bearman was clear that using the battery to fill in for turbo lag is not the best approach.</p><p>&quot;The battery has to kind of save you and give you that power. But of course, that&apos;s very inefficient,&quot; he said. &quot;You don&apos;t feel the turbo lag, you just lose out on that time because you start clipping [running out of electrical energy] a bit earlier.&quot;</p><p>Everything has therefore come together to mean race starts will need a lot of work to perfect.</p><p>As Norris explained, it&apos;s an area of the race weekend now that is going to be very difficult to execute on many fronts.</p><p>&quot;You [previously] used the battery to get the turbo perfectly balanced, and then you&apos;d have just a very nice bleed out using battery and the combustion engine [together],&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Now it&apos;s a lot more complicated. As soon as you start to use any battery to help in any situation, you&apos;re just taking away a lot of battery to use for the rest of the lap.</p><p>&quot;So you maybe have a better start, but you can also run out of battery by the time you get to Turn 1 - in some places like Mexico, for example. So, there&apos;s going to be some complications.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the Ducatis clearly went full-tilt on fresh rubber, it is known for instance that Marco Bezzecchi ran on very used rubber, so there&apos;s no concern from Aprilia.</p><p>And there were some other oddities - Ai Ogura was unwell, Enea Bastianini had bad vibration front and rear, the Hondas all did 11 laps for some reason when the Malaysia sprint is 10.&#xA0;</p><p>Plus, the Ducatis were already this quick in the sprint simulations in the same test last year.</p><p>But there was still clearly a bit of a tone shift to one of more cold realism from some of its rivals.</p><p>Pedro Acosta acknowledged the sprint pace wasn&apos;t optimal - but also that Ducati was clearly a step ahead. And Joan Mir said: &quot;It was good but if you check the pace of the Ducati guys, especially Alex - we are far [away], eh? We are far. We made an improvement compared to last year, it&apos;s not a bad pace, but I think Ducati made a step this pre-season.&quot;</p><p>Honda still faces a significant grip deficit, Mir said. &quot;If tomorrow is a race, I think we can fight for top five, top four but not a lot more,&quot; he added - and he joked that if he tried to match the quickest lap of Alex Marquez&apos;s sprint simulation, a 1m57.295s, &quot;the next lap is a 2m01s because I cook the tyre completely&quot;.</p><h2 id="marquez-is-malaysian-gp-favourite">Marquez is Malaysian GP favourite</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/GnG_1289965_HiRes.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Six things we learned from MotoGP&apos;s Sepang test" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/GnG_1289965_HiRes.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/GnG_1289965_HiRes.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/GnG_1289965_HiRes.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w2400/2026/02/GnG_1289965_HiRes.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>...if it happened tomorrow.</p><p>And yes, that&apos;s Alex Marquez, not Marc.</p><p>The test marked more or less the first official incorporation of the younger Marquez into Ducati&apos;s works fleet - he is not contracted to Ducati but has been upgraded to the latest-spec bike, so is participating in development.</p><p>Ducati&apos;s big development question during the test was aero, with riders juggling various specs on front and side - with 2024 stuff, 2025 stuff and the newest 2026 stuff in use.</p><p>A homologation decision will be required before the start of the season, and should come early in the next test in Thailand, though some directions are already becoming clear (and it doesn&apos;t sound like the &apos;26 &apos;droopier&apos; front aero, for example, is being particularly favoured).&#xA0;</p><p>Alex is an involved part of this process now, instead of a satellite rider allowed to pound laps and hone set-up on a hand-me-down bike that needs no spec decisions.</p><p>But that extra responsibility has certainly not made him slow. The younger Marquez is a well-known Sepang maestro, and he laid down the marker here over both one lap and the sprint distance.</p><p>More remarkably, he wasn&apos;t even particularly happy with his sprint simulation.</p><p>&quot;I think I pushed a little bit too much [early on],&quot; he said.&#xA0; &quot;Later on, I did mistakes, it&apos;s the first simulation that we made this year, so- I did too many mistakes, small ones, but too many mistakes, and one big one. So I lost there like one second or more.&#xA0;</p><p>I felt like I think we are a little bit better than last year, a little bit more competitive, not a big step.&quot;</p><h2 id="the-champion-is-easing-himself-in">The champion is easing himself in</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/GnG_1290005_HiRes.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Six things we learned from MotoGP&apos;s Sepang test" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/GnG_1290005_HiRes.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/GnG_1290005_HiRes.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/GnG_1290005_HiRes.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w2400/2026/02/GnG_1290005_HiRes.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Back on a MotoGP bike for the first time since Mandalika last October, Marc Marquez was immediately competitive but overall unremarkable - if only by his own stratospheric standards.</p><p>&quot;We need to improve. Because there are two-three riders that are faster than us,&quot; he admitted to MotoGP.com after the test.&#xA0;</p><p>Rider one is clearly Alex Marquez. Rider two is almost-as-clearly Bagnaia, who would also be a prime contender for grand prix honours if they all went racing at Sepang this weekend.</p><p>Bagnaia felt he may have erred with the timing of his qualifying sim relative to track condition, and was running low on front grip at the end of sprint simulation, but he has been consistent in saying that he feels more confidence in the front of this bike than the &apos;25 he&apos;d suffered with through his awful last season.</p><p>Rider three is almost certainly Bezzecchi - the Aprilia isn&apos;t supposed to be amazing here, but he&apos;s been sneaky fast throughout before delivering a very convincing laptime late on.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Marc can live with losing to his brother and his team-mate here. He has made that very clear - Sepang doesn&apos;t favour him, so no alarm bells will be ringing.</p><p>And he&apos;s just not quite fit yet, especially under the physical pressure of extensive test mileage, with Marquez admitting his body position wasn&apos;t right by the end of the test.</p><h2 id="alarm-bells-ringing">Alarm bells ringing</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/GnG_1289847_HiRes.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Six things we learned from MotoGP&apos;s Sepang test" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/GnG_1289847_HiRes.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/GnG_1289847_HiRes.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/GnG_1289847_HiRes.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w2400/2026/02/GnG_1289847_HiRes.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Most riders steadfastly describe themselves as &quot;happy&quot; at the end of every test. Not to cast aspersions, but a fair few of them have almost certainly been lying over the years - and maybe today, too.</p><p>One rider who wasn&apos;t lying was Trackhouse sophomore Ogura - who admitted he was &quot;not so happy&quot; and not as fast as he expected.</p><p>His sprint simulation was clearly a bit of a mess, his single-lap effort more in the mix but not great, and corner speed just wasn&apos;t where he wanted it at. He also was, however, noticeably unwell with a cold, though &quot;on the bike I was fine, not 100% fine but enough to ride&quot;.</p><p>Team-mate Raul Fernandez was perkier - and healthier - but admitted the single-lap pace isn&apos;t quite coming together.</p><p>Equally, going for a fast time seemed to be problematic for KTM&#x2019;s Brad Binder, which is a distinctly worrying sign given he had gone 0-22 against team-mate Acosta in qualifying last year, and that this was by far the biggest contributor to a disappointing season.</p><p>&quot;For sure I&apos;d like to have been a lot faster&quot; was his admission. He was more comfortable on the bike but hasn&apos;t yet been able to get that comfort to translate on the stopwatch.</p><p>One rider who did sound a bit out of the woods on Thursday was LCR Honda&apos;s Johann Zarco, but question marks still remain.</p><p>Zarco contrasted the positivity of factory riders Mir and Luca Marini through the first two days with his own compromised feeling on the bike, which continued a worrying trend from the second half of 2025 - when he just didn&apos;t gel with the upgraded Honda.</p><p>He felt some progress was made on his final day here, while also emphasising that he &quot;cannot copy&quot; the bikes Mir and Marini are riding even if their feedback is very positive.</p><h2 id="razgatlioglu-is-facing-his-first-setbacks">Razgatlioglu is facing his first setbacks</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/GnG_1290051_HiRes.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Six things we learned from MotoGP&apos;s Sepang test" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/GnG_1290051_HiRes.jpg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/GnG_1290051_HiRes.jpg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/GnG_1290051_HiRes.jpg 1600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w2400/2026/02/GnG_1290051_HiRes.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Pramac Yamaha rookie Toprak Razgatlioglu had an almost suspiciously rosy start to MotoGP life in the year-closing tests of last year - but five days at Sepang (three in the shakedown, two in the test) clearly drove home some harsh truths about the size of the task in adapting from World Superbikes.</p><p>Razgatlioglu admitted he was &quot;angry&quot; looking at the timesheets, staring at what in the end was a 3s deficit to the front.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/FW48-FW-Highlight.jpg" alt="Gary Anderson&apos;s verdict on the real 2026 Williams F1 car"><p>After <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/what-latest-painful-f1-car-delay-has-exposed-about-vowles-williams/" rel="noreferrer">missing the behind-closed-doors shakedown</a> at Barcelona, then putting out a <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/zero-rods-unusual-2026-williams-f1-showcar-explained/" rel="noreferrer">completely unrepresentative livery launch car</a> a couple of days ago, Williams has finally run its 2026 Formula 1 car for the first time at Silverstone on a filming day.</p><p>It starts this season behind the eight ball, which wasn&#x2019;t the intention last season when the team declared it was forgoing development on its &#x2018;25 car to be well-prepared for this year.</p><p>In F1, planning and component manufacturing has become as much of a priority, if not a higher priority, than design time. It&#x2019;s one thing that brought the initial success to Red Bull, as it was the first to recognise that it&#x2019;s all well and good coming up with something new, but you need to be able to turn it around into components very quickly otherwise it will be superseded by the next great idea.</p><p>Being late with the new car means Williams is not there yet as far as that is concerned. Not getting the car ready in time and missing the first three days of running will have an ongoing effect on development through the season. The question is, how big will that negative impact be?</p><p>We only have one picture to go on, and we will see far more when the car runs in the Bahrain test next week. But there is plenty to see in this one image. As normal, let&#x2019;s start where the airflow structure gets its initial flow deviation from.</p><p>The front wing endplates have the central horizontal fin, as highlighted with the orange ellipse below. Underneath that, highlighted with the yellow ellipse, at the end of the footplate tunnel is a ramp. This should increase the flow through that tunnel, improving the performance of the wing itself.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Williams-1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson&apos;s verdict on the real 2026 Williams F1 car" loading="lazy" width="1573" height="921" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Williams-1.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/Williams-1.jpeg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Williams-1.jpeg 1573w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>On the other side of the car, I have highlighted these components in the same colours above to show what the profile should do to the airflow. As you can see, the outer ramp on that central vane is only on the outboard end and vertically above the lower ramp. Both of these should work together, but will be influenced by the steering angle. This means they could be inconsistent due to varying corner radii.</p><p>The front suspension is interesting. It has stuck with the pullrod-operated system, which is highlighted in red. It also seems to have increased the anti-dive and is very similar to what we saw on the Aston Martin.</p><p>The top wishbone forward leg, highlighted in dark blue below, has its inboard pick-up point mounted very high. The rear leg, highlighted in light blue, has its inboard pick-up point mounted fairly low. It looks like, as with the Aston Martin, it&#x2019;s a long way rearward, meaning a wide-based A-frame style wishbone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Williams-2.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson&apos;s verdict on the real 2026 Williams F1 car" loading="lazy" width="1573" height="921" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Williams-2.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/Williams-2.jpeg 1000w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Williams-2.jpeg 1573w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As for the lower wishbone, positioning-wise I believe (but could be wrong) that the forward leg is the component that I have highlighted in green above. To achieve a sensible suspension geometry, it runs at a similar angle to the top wishbone forward leg.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t see the rear leg of the lower wishbone clearly, but if that front leg position is correct then the rear leg could mount on the chassis in the same area as the top wishbone rearward leg. That&#x2019;s unusual, but as long as it gives a reasonable suspension geometry, it could save weight in the chassis structure.</p><p>If the wishbone positioning above is correct, then the trackrod could be the component highlighted in yellow. It also seems to show that it comes from behind the lower wishbone forward leg inboard mount position to forward of the lower wishbone outboard point.</p><p>As the outboard pivot points for the top and bottom wishbone are fairly central to the wheel and upright assembly, it would have to do this to achieve the required steering arm length on the upright assembly.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Williams-3.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson&apos;s verdict on the real 2026 Williams F1 car" loading="lazy" width="544" height="284"></figure><p>The radiator inlet is, to say the least, far from the smallest I have seen so far this season. So I&#x2019;m not sure about this or why you would compromise the overall aerodynamic flow structure so early with this size of opening. I need to see more of the side profiles to see if it is working in conjunction with anything new in that area.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Williams-4.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Gary Anderson&apos;s verdict on the real 2026 Williams F1 car" loading="lazy" width="790" height="371" srcset="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Williams-4.jpeg 600w, https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/Williams-4.jpeg 790w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The airbox intake, highlighted in green with the roll bar structure highlighted in red going through it, is again fairly large. The combination of both these two intakes means Williams should have enough cooling capacity for the hottest of circuits.</p><p>If you are a mid-performing team that expects to be running in traffic for most of the race,&#xA0; a little extra cooling will do no harm. However, giving away too much overall aerodynamic performance in preparation for that could just ensure that you will be running in traffic.</p><p>It&#x2019;s too early, and there are not enough real pictures, for an in-depth analysis on the Williams. However, I&#x2019;m pleased to see it has not stood still on the front suspension layout. This geometry being very similar to what Adrian Newey instigated, or allowed to happen, at Aston Martin will give Williams confidence that it was not just a mad &#x2018;eureka&#x2019; moment. Also, integrating it with the pullrod, in my opinion, is not wrong. Having said that, it&#x2019;s all about breaking new ground for the correct reasons and not just because of a wild idea.</p><p>Roll on Bahrain testing. It&apos;s time to really see who has what up their sleeve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/GnG_1289724_HiRes.jpg" alt="Alex Marquez says MotoGP 2027 decision imminent"><p>Gresini MotoGP rider Alex Marquez expects that he will be one of the riders to have their contract for 2027 sorted before the start of the 2026 season.</p><p>Marquez, who finished second in the championship last year and has been the standout rider of the three days of post-season testing at his probable best MotoGP track Sepang, has his market value at an all-time high in the premier class.</p><p>And with frenzied movement between riders and teams as MotoGP&apos;s five manufacturers all manoeuvre to have their leading riders secured already for the switch to new bike regulations and Pirelli tyres in 2027, Marquez too appears to be in enough demand not to be biding his time.</p><p>&quot;Before the first race, I will decide,&quot; he said. &quot;I will have clear what I will do in &apos;27.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;But at the moment I&apos;m quite calm, I know more or less which options we have on the table, but still working on that, and then I will decide - if I can decide before the [second pre-season] test in Thailand, I will do it, if not I will wait a little bit. But before the first race I want to have my future closed.&quot;</p><p>Marquez would naturally not disclose the full range of options at his disposal - but he confirmed that one of those is remaining at Gresini.</p><p>&quot;I have it quite clear.</p><p>&quot;The most solid one is the Gresini one. Because I know the team, I know everything, and the emotional side - that is important for a rider - is there. But, you know... later on, if it&apos;s one year that you can take a risk, it&apos;s next year, because nobody knows which way will be the best one. I will see, and I think for that reason, everything, the market is quite crazy.&quot;</p><p>It is widely understood that Marquez, who will turn 30 in April, is deliberating between Gresini and a move to a factory seat - which he hadn&apos;t had in MotoGP since his rookie season in 2020.</p><p>Back then, with COVID delaying the start of the season, Marquez knew before he&apos;d done a single race lap in Repsol Honda colours that he would be demoted to a satellite team the following year.</p><p>Yamaha and particularly KTM have been floated as the factories with current interest in the Gresini riders - and it has been rumoured that his discussions with KTM had reached quite an advanced stage.</p><p>Such an early commitment to Marquez - which might come hand-in-hand with the signing of Maverick Vinales as his team-mate, as it is thought KTM has made peace with losing star rider Pedro Acosta at the end of the year - would re-affirm the once-beleagured Austrian manufacturer&apos;s longer-term MotoGP plans, which its motorsport boss Pit Beirer claimed had the blessing of the board and particularly of new owner Bajaj Auto.</p><p>On Yamaha&apos;s end, its MotoGP boss Paolo Pavesio insisted when speaking to The Race that Yamaha was still waiting for a decision from lead rider Fabio Quartararo.</p><p>Quartararo was reported as having agreed a Honda deal but Pavesio - despite reports that Yamaha has already secured Jorge Martin as replacement - claims he has not been informed of any final decision by Quartararo.</p><p>&quot;In the end, rumours are rumours,&quot; Pavesio told The Race. &quot;Our target is to develop the best bike we can, to have good riders willing to race with us. We have a fantastic rider with us, Fabio - if Fabio will decide to go together for the future, we will be very happy, and we&apos;re working for this. In this moment, he told us - and he&apos;s telling us - he has not made up his mind yet.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;So here we are. But in parallel, of course, our job, my job is to be ready with all the possible scenarios.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.the-race.com/content/images/2026/02/G_w-78TWgAAWn9I-1.jpeg" alt="Why Norris thinks 2026 F1 races will be more chaotic"><p>Formula 1 races are set to be a bit more &#x201C;chaotic&#x2019; in 2026 thanks to quirks of the new rules, reckons world champion Lando Norris.</p><p>While an increased reliance on the battery element of the all-new cars means they have a lot of power, those batteries run out of energy and need to be constantly recharged.</p><p>And that means there are occasions when drivers will run out of boost around the lap, which can leave them vulnerable to an attack by their rivals who have more power on tap.</p><p>For Norris, who got his first taste of the F1 2026 machinery during last week&#x2019;s first pre-season test at Barcelona, the big speed differentials between cars that have maximum power versus those that don&#x2019;t is going to trigger a lot of toing and froing of positions.</p><p>&#x201C;You&apos;ll see more moves with extra speed,&#x201D; he said speaking to selected media this week.</p><p>&#x201C;But then that person might have to defend more than what you&apos;ve seen in the past.</p><p>&#x201C;And that will create more chaos, which is great for you guys.&#x201D;</p><p>Norris suggested that things will be made more hectic by how easy the passing will be on the straights, and even in places where in the past it was nearly impossible to overtake.</p><p>&#x201C;I think what you&apos;re going to see is generally just more that you can have almost more chaotic racing depending on when people use the boost button and at what times,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>&#x201C;There&apos;s a lot of straights and places, even at Barcelona, where you don&apos;t really deploy the battery that much. Let&apos;s say between Turn 5 and Turn 7. It&apos;s a little straight.</p><p>&#x201C;But if you use boost out of it, you gain a good amount of horsepower. And you can overtake someone into T7, which you&apos;ve never normally seen before.</p><p>&#x201C;The only thing is, then you&apos;re screwed down to T10. So yeah, you&apos;ll be able to force people more in different positions and kind of create racing, potentially in better ways than you have been able to in the past.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="high-speed-chess">High-speed chess</h2><p>This rapid shuffling of positions as energy levels ebb and flow between cars will put the onus on drivers to cleverly manage where they choose to harvest their battery power and where they choose to deploy it.</p><p>Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli thinks it is going to require some strategic thinking in the cockpit to come out on top.</p><p>&#x201C;The way you race, the way you have to use your energy while fighting with others, that is a very big step,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>&#x201C;I think this year, you have to come into the season very open-minded and, in some ways, you need to be very creative as well. </p><p>&quot;You can play so much with the energy, especially when fighting other people.</p><p>&#x201C;It&apos;s like playing chess, but like a kind of speed chess. Obviously, you don&apos;t have as much time to think for every move, but this year you always have to try and be two steps ahead of the others.&#x201D;</p><p>Norris agrees that drivers are going to have to be very switched on in how they plan things, especially if things get a bit crazy around them.</p><p>&#x201C;I certainly think there&apos;s a bit more emphasis on how the driver can handle and control all of these things, both in a qualifying lap, but also in racing situations,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>&#x201C;I think it&apos;s going to be more complicated to understand, [especially] how to prepare overtakes.</p><p>&#x201C;Before it was pretty simple in terms of you drive as quickly as possible, but avoid the dirty air. It was quite easy to build up the battery in a good and efficient way.</p><p>&#x201C;Now, when you use up your battery, you are going to lose quite a bit of time, and you&apos;re going to lose a lot more on the straights.</p><p>&#x201C;So I think you&apos;re going to see more chaos and races where a driver has to be a little bit more on top of all of these different situations that can happen.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="not-convinced-yet">Not convinced yet</h2><p>Norris has said he has been encouraged by some of the characteristics of the F1 2026 cars - such as the way the power is deployed so rapidly.</p><p>However, he says he would love to experience them where the energy does not run out so rapidly.</p><p>&#x201C;It certainly feels more powerful,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Right now, you stop deploying halfway down the straight but if you didn&#x2019;t, and you just let it run to the max, you&apos;d easily be hitting probably 380km/h or something.</p><p>&#x201C;So the cars, effectively, could do a lot more. So if you would say, unleash the F1 car, you could almost achieve even more.&#x201D;</p><p>He also suggested that the first feedback of how they handled and behaved around Barcelona has not yet convinced him - which is why he wants to see them on a different type of track.</p><p>&quot;It feels more like an F2 car in some ways, with how you have to drive it,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know if I like that or not, for the time being, but I think we understood quite a few things already from Barcelona on how you had to drive the car.</p><p>&quot;But Barcelona, you&apos;re talking about fourth gear corners, third gear corners, quite open, quite wide, When you get to a street track or bumpier tracks, slower tracks? That&apos;s a question we have yet to answer. </p><p>&quot;But Bahrain will answer some of those questions.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The faster driver will be the one who still comes out on top. I don&apos;t think it will be an engineering race from the cockpit.&#x201D;</p><p>The devil is in the detail. Small differences in braking technique, the way you approach corner-entry to achieve the required rotation, how you overlap throttle and brake and countless other factors all have an influence. </p><p>But as Haas driver Ollie Bearman explains, the fundamental feeling of the car and the driving style doesn&#x2019;t seem too different compared to last year.</p><p>&#x201C;The first sensation is the lack of downforce compared to what we&apos;ve been used to, particularly in the medium and the low speed [corners],&#x201D; said Bearman. </p><p>&#x201C;The high speed is what you expect. You have less load, but your braking zones are slightly longer, your combined traction is a bit more challenging just because you have even a bit more power in that phase and less load on the car, so less mechanical grip with smaller tyres.</p><p>&#x201C;It&apos;s definitely a bit different. I didn&apos;t find the driving style to be too dissimilar. It just was more similar to your Monzas and your Mexicos where you have a bit less downforce. </p><p>&quot;It&apos;s still very fun to drive. Even if the car&apos;s moving around a bit more, that&#x2019;s not necessarily a bad thing.&#x201D;</p><p>The driver&#x2019;s domain is the corner, as it&#x2019;s here that they can express their craft and gain laptime. However, the unusual characteristics of these power units means that the approach to the corner can start earlier than it once did owing to the need to maximise harvesting.</p><p>&#x201C;At times it can,&#x201D; said Lando Norris when asked about drivers downshifting early towards the end of straights. </p><p>&#x201C;The biggest challenge at the minute is battery management and knowing how to utilise that in the best way. You can explain it in quite simple terms: you have a very powerful battery that doesn&apos;t last very long so knowing how to use it in the right times, how much energy, how much of that power you use, how to split it up around the lap, and how you can recover the batteries as well as possible. </p><p>&quot;And that&apos;s when it comes down to using the gears, hitting the right revs.&#x201D;</p><p>This is complicated further by the fact that different deployment strategies can vary the straightline performance from lap to lap. </p><p>As Norris points out, &#x201C;If you suddenly have a bit more power you can end up going into a corner 5, 6, 7km/h quicker all of a sudden without potentially knowing why.&quot; </p><p>That then leads into a slightly longer, but still short, braking zone thanks to the reduction in downforce even once the car switches from straightline mode to corner mode.</p><p>The downshifts are also complicated by sometimes having to go to a lower gear than would have been the case last year. </p><p>The aggression of the downshifts could also change in terms of what revs the change is being made at because this can help increase the energy harvested. </p><p>There were occasions under the old regulations when Alpine, struggling with a relatively weaker charging capability in its Renault engine, would have slightly more savage gearchanges as a result. </p><p>This can have a dynamic impact on the turn-in of the car. </p><p>Then, while you want to maximise the speed carried through and out of the corner, there&#x2019;s also the question of ensuring you do that in an energy efficient way in terms of both what you are spending, and what you are harvesting. That includes being cautious on the throttle in slow sections given a certain level of pedal demand will mean the MGU-K kicks in when you don&apos;t want to be using battery energy.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s definitely challenging for the drivers and you have instances where, when you go around the corners faster, you&apos;re spending more energy and you&apos;re harvesting less, so you end up over the course of the lap having less energy to spend,&#x201D; said Russell.</p><p>&#x201C;You may gain a few tenths in the corners, but you may lose a couple of tenths in the straight. So that takes a little bit of time just to get your head around it.</p><p>&quot;However, once you do get your head around it, that would just be the normal way of driving. All the teams are having to use quite low gears through the corners, to maximise the harvesting, all of which we had question marks around. But it just feels like a race car.&#x201D;</p><p>Among all of this, the driver must keep in mind what Russell calls &#x201C;the small techniques that will gain you a couple of percent of energy re-harvesting&#x201D;. </p><p>This could potentially be huge. If you can modify your technique to optimise that while still being quick through the corner, that will pay you back later in the lap.</p><p>The drivers who master this will likely be the most effective, but it cannot fail to have an impact on the car dynamically when on the limit and, as the struggle of Lewis Hamilton to adapt to the cars in the ground effect era shows, the requirements of car and driver might not always align.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s lots of counter-intuitive things everywhere in this regulation,&#x201D; said Komatsu, who had a long history as a race engineer before moving up the team leadership ladder, when asked by The Race about the driving style demands.</p><p>&#x201C;From a pure driving perspective, lift and coasting potential in qualifying, and then gear usage and on throttle, etc.</p><p>&#x201C;There&apos;s lots of conflicting objectives the driver needs to achieve. But I&apos;m sure over time, we engineers will be able to design and hone both hardware and software so that drivers are able to do something much more intuitive to get performance out of it.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the very, very early stages of the regulation. That&apos;s why there&apos;s lots of this contradiction and counter-intuitive things happening. It&#x2019;s a lot more hard work. They need to sometimes think differently.</p><p>&#x201C;But then, there&apos;s a trade-off. Let&apos;s say certain things a driver has to do to maximise recovery makes the car very difficult to drive. Where&apos;s the right balance?</p><p>&quot;Maybe you have to give the driver a more driveable car and accept that you&apos;re not going to be deploying as much energy down the straight? That is a very difficult optimisation problem to solve.&#x201D;</p><p>Then when it comes to getting the power down off the corner, there&#x2019;s the twin challenge of ideally needing to have the turbo spinning at a decent enough rate to minimise lag and avoid having to use too much electrical energy to compensate for any missing V6 power, and not overstress the tyres.</p><p>&#x201C;We need to be very careful to not kill the tyres completely, because it&apos;s so much more than it was before,&#x201D; said Ocon. </p><p>&#x201C;At the moment, we have less grip than we had in the last couple of years. The car itself is quite nice to drive because it slides a bit more. It&apos;s a bit more like the 2020s era, where it was a bit less snappy and a bit more comfortable at high speed. On that side of things, it was quite nice to drive.&#x201D;</p><p>And all that must be done in a race while using tools such as the boost button or, when available, overtake mode to battle with other cars.</p><p>Setting aside the energy-management requirements, there&#x2019;s also the question of whether the move away from low-slung, ultra-stiff venturi tunnel cars will allow a wider range of set-ups and not force the drivers into a narrow driving style window. According to Bearman, there&#x2019;s an improvement on this score but how big an impact this will have is not yet clear.</p><p>&#x201C;With this generation, we&apos;re a bit unsure,&#x201D; said Bearman when asked by The Race.</p><p>&#x201C;We think as the regs mature a little, we&apos;re going to hopefully get a bit more flexibility and freedom with ride heights, but at the moment we don&apos;t have a crazy freedom like prior to the &apos;22 regs, we&apos;re not anywhere near back at those levels. It&apos;s not like we&apos;re [at] those crazy rear ride heights as before.</p><p>&#x201C;So we&apos;re certainly softer just by virtue of the fact of the SM [straightline mode] meaning you have flexibility to run the car a bit softer [as you are] not limited by ride height at the end of the straight, so that&apos;s a nice thing. </p><p>&quot;But physics will tell you that the car is fastest at X ride height, [so] we run it at X ride height, our preference doesn&apos;t really matter.</p><p>&#x201C;I believe at this stage, there&apos;s not really much flexibility to express yourself with set-up and things like that. Maybe as time goes on and maybe the more performant cars will be the ones that can produce load over a wider range of ride height. At this early stage it&#x2019;s not quite the case.&#x201D;</p><p>With the caveat that there hasn&#x2019;t yet been the opportunity to observe these cars from trackside to understand more about the driving styles being used, it does at least appear that it&#x2019;s not simply an energy-management exercise. </p><p>Efficiency has always been part of the competitive equation for the person behind the wheel and there&#x2019;s an artistry to being able to do so while driving these incredibly fast cars to the limit.</p><p>However, it&#x2019;s still early days. </p><p>There are legitimate question marks about whether the compromises forced by the need to harvest so much energy over a lap to be quick will be so large a part of the laptime equation that it neuters the best drivers in the world. But based on first impressions, F1 is far from that nightmare scenario.</p>]]></content:encoded>
